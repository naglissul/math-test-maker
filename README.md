3. Insert pictures, drawn problems, check answers from html generated file.
4. Host generated test with link, sends answers to teacher, check answers also with a link for teachers.

## Money

sukurktesta.lt domain price is 7.99e, 8.99e, 8.99e... per year (Hostinger)

AWS is complicated...

Idea is to buy the domain, start hosting on AWS for what is free tier and hope to gather money from donations to payback the domain and a little bit forward for the AWS pricing. And then track how much is spent on website and how much money received from donations.

All of that while paying taxes as for "Individuali veikla" form FR0468
